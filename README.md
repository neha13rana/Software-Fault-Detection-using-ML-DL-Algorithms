software issues is the objective. It provides a three-step
method to improve forecast accuracy and uses metrics to
evaluate efficiency. Improving the accuracy and reliability
of software failure prediction is the main objective of the work.

**Conclusion :**

We have conducted an evaluation and comparison of different approaches for predicting software defects using deep learning (DL) and machine learning (ML). We found that DL is better at identifying complex patterns, while ML is faster and more transparent, especially when using ANNs and LSTMs. In our study, we introduced RNNBDL, a novel technique that combines LSTM and BiLSTM to improve predictions. We also highlighted the trade-offs between interpretability, processing speed, and prediction strength when selecting algorithms designed for specific datasets. Various methods, such as SVM, Naive Bayes, RF, LSTM, BiLSTM, and RBFN, can be used to reduce testing costs and improve software quality. Ensemble methods like stacking and SVM-PSO offer high accuracy for fault prediction. We emphasized the importance of data processing and methodological decisions in obtaining accurate software failure rates. Our study demonstrates how the application of DL and ML methods can improve early error detection and reduce testing costs in software engineering. As the field progresses, the selection of algorithms and data organization will remain crucial for enhancing prediction models in practical software engineering scenarios.
